## This is a test lesson and its aim is to let you practice with that flow we're going to follow.

### Before you start

1. You should be familiar with Git. At least with Git basics. To do so please visit http://git-scm.com/documentation
2. Create an GitHub account if you still don't have one - https://github.com/join
3. Install Git on your local environment - http://git-scm.com/downloads
4. Learn how to fork repositories - https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
5. Learn how to work with pull-requests - https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

### To start doing the lesson please follow the instructions below:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork to your local environment
3. When the repository is cloned, go to the following path - week0/workplace
4. Create there a folder in the following format - name.surname
5. Under the folder you've created create an empty text file with any name
6. Commit the file and push the changes
7. Initiate, review and send a pull-request
8. Wait until the pull-request is reviewed. It could be either closed or merged, in other terms: rejected or accepted. In any case take into account all comments if those were done.
9. If the pull-request was closed (rejected) carefully read our comments, fix issues and go back to the step 6.
10. If the pull-request was merged (accepted), our congratulations, you've just finished the lesson. Go forward to the next one.
